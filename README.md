I was motivated to create a web roulette board game to make an interaction between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I wanted to use explore some of the new skills I have learned such as ES6 and learn to use DOM Manipulation better. I have used the similar technique when I made my previous project(Tic-Tac-Toe), but I have added some more features such as random generator and some functions that will interact differently when the conditions are different.

This roulette table lets a player make a bet and if the player wins, the current money will be multiplied accordingly to the number the player played.
